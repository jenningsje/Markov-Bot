Dear Dr. Pisters,

I hope you are doing w. I am James Jennings, Co-Founder of Integral Sequencing. Over recent months, I have had the privilege of working with MD Anderson researchers, including Dr. Hannah Beird, as part of a CPRIT-backed project now under full peer review.

Our initiative leverages artificial super-intelligence to automate synthetic biology workflows aimed at personalizing oncology treatment. By simulating over 500 million treatment pathways annually, the platform is designed to optimize therapies for up to 100,000 patients, aligning closely with MD Andersonâ€™s mission of advancing cancer research and patient care.

I am reaching out to explore potential collaboration opportunities and would be grateful for the chance to discuss how our technology might complement ongoing efforts at MD Anderson.

For your convenience, I have attached a summary presentation and the approved CPRIT proposal for your review. Please let me know if you or a member of your team would be interested in a brief meeting or call to explore this further.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Warm regards,
James Jennings
Co-Founder, Integral Sequencing
